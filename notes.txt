LazyInitializationException - mark method @Transactional
Cannot use identity column key generation with <union-subclass> ( TABLE_PER_CLASS ) -- change ID generatedvalue to .TABLE
@Test will automatically rollback. To overwrite, do @Rollback(value = false) on the test class

With @OneToMany unidirectional association you need to manually define the column with FK on the target entity. See example: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/OneToMany#Unidirectional_OneToMany.2C_No_Inverse_ManyToOne.2C_No_Join_Table_.28JPA_2.x_ONLY.29

@Transactional is by default "PROPAGATION_REQUIRED", which means that it will "latch" onto an existing (parent) transaction if there is one, or create its own, if there is no existing.
